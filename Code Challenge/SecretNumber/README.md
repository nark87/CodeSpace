# Code Challenge - Higher/Lower Game

Higher/Lower Game:
- Generates a random number.
- Takes in a guess.
- Returns a string with the guess and whether that guess is lower or higher than the random number. 
    E.g., You answered 9. The correct answer is higher.
- If the guess matches the random number, then return a string which confirms this. 
    E.g., You answered 9. This is the correct answer!


Next Steps:

- Create a function when user don not have more chances - End Game
    - Not to repeat lines of code when the game is finished.

- Create a mmultidimensional array for capsulating the attributes of the 3 levels

- Continue with 3 levels of the game
    - Level easy is only working
    - Create a button listener for medium and expert levels

- Use css to have a user friendly interface

- Create with cypress some testing
    - One for each level
