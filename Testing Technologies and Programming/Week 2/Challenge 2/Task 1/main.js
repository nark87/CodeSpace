// Coding Task 1 - Classes and Objects
/* In this task your are required to create a user application.

Let's write a user class with the tools we have just acquired. 
This class will contain the first and  last name of each user and will be able to say hello to anyone who uses our application.

Instructions:

Write the class User and add the properties.
Add the method that says hello.
Create the first instance, and call it user1. Use the new keyword to create an object from the class.
Set the values for the first and last name to user1.

firstName = 'John'
lastName = 'Doe'

Get the user first and last name, and print it to the screen.
Use the hello() method with the first and last name variables in order to say hello to the user:

Expected result:
hello, John Doe

Add another object, call it user2, give it a first name of 'Jane' and last name of 'Doe', then say hello to the user.

Expected result:
hello, John Doe
hello, Jane Doe */

class User {
   // Constructor
   constructor (firstName, lastName) {

      // Initialise Attributes 
      this._firstName = firstName;
      this._lastName = lastName;
   }

   // Method to say hello
   hello() {
      console.log(`Hello, ${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`);
   }
}

// Create the first user instance
const user1 = new User("John", "Doe");
console.log("First Name:", user1._firstName);
console.log("Last Name:", user1._lastName);
user1.hello(); 

// Create the second user instance
const user2 = new User("Jane", "Doe");
user2.hello();
